Mirror Networking for beginners.

I've put together a working scene with some basic implementation of Mirror networking, spawning a player, shooting and syncing bullets.

I hope i've been clear enough in comments in the code. If there is anything you would like to add, just create an issue / pull.

I will continuely update this guide and adding more features.
